from   ("|FRAME: Carrageenans Carrageenans| and |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| are sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from sea weeds belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-2763| (red algae), mainly from |FRAME: TAX-2769|, and species from the |FRAME: TAX-31444| and |FRAME: TAX-33664| genera. They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.

The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the
number and the position of sulfated ester |CITS: [1367970]|. 

In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.

The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.")

[Slot COMMENT in DsrC-persulfides changed
from   ("The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.

DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 

In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides \"a perthiol on CysA\"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form \"an intramolecular disulfide bond\"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.

In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.

In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.")

[Slot COMMENT in Oxidized-flavodoxins changed
from   ("Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.

Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins \"oxidized form\"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 

Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.

Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.

Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

[Slot COMMENT in DOLICHOL changed
from   ("|FRAME: DOLICHOL \"Dolichol\"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit |CITS: [9363431][21091511]|.

The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS \"N-glycosylation\"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.

Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra |FRAME: CPD-12419| |CITS: [15686500]|.

[Slot COMMENT in Reduced-flavodoxins changed
from   ("Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.

Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins \"oxidized form\"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 

Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.

Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.

Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.")

[Slot COMMENT in Flavodoxin changed
from   ("Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.

Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN \"flavin mononucleotide\"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins \"oxidized form\"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 

Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.

Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.

Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in Lipoproteins changed
from   ("The broad definition of a |FRAME: Lipoproteins lipoprotein| is a protein to which lipids are bound. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are lipoproteins, including the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins that carry fats in the blood stream.
The lipoprotein known as |FRAME: EG10544-MONOMER| (Lpp) is considered the most abundant protein in |FRAME: TAX-562| and accounts for more than 40% of the peptidoglycan on a weight basis. It is necessary for the stabilization and integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and is thought to physically tether the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer |CITS:[4899922][4565677][4578317]|.

Membrane-attached lipoproteins of Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria are tethered to the membrane by an <i>N</i>-acyl-(<i>S</i>-diacylglyceryl)-cysteine anchor that is variably acylated depending on the genus. In many Gram-positive bacteria certain variations exist (see below).

In bacteria all lipoproteins are initially translated as precursors (|FRAME: Prolipoproteins prolipoproteins|) containing an N-terminal signal peptide that contains a conserved lipobox motif sequence preceding a cysteine residue |CITS: [12876315][19367716]|. Once transported to the outer face of the membrane, |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.145| (Lgt) attaches a diacylglycerol moiety from a phospholipid donor by a thioether bond to the cysteine residue |CITS: [8051048]|.
In most organisms |FRAME: EC-3.4.23.36| (Lsp) then cleaves the leader peptide leaving the cysteine as the N-terminal amino acid of the protein |CITS: [7040395]|. However, it has been found that in |FRAME: TAX-2115| the peptide is cleaved two amino acids away from the cysteine (towards the N-terminus) |CITS: [22303020]|.
In Gram-negative bacteria biosynthesis is completed by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.269| (Lnt), which transfers a fatty acid from a membrane phospholipid to form an amide linkage with the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, generating a triacylated molecule |CITS: [2032623]|.

More variety is found in some low GC Gram-positive bacteria. Three new forms have been observed - a |FRAME: Peptidyl-Form-Lipoprotein-N-terminus \"peptidyl form\"| (which results from the alternative cleaving by Lsp, with two amino acids present before the lipid-modified cysteine residue, which is described above), an |FRAME: N-Acetyl-Lipoprotein \"<i>N</i>-acetyl form\"|, and an <i>N</i>-acylated monoacyl-glyceryl form known as the |FRAME: Lyso-Form-Lipoprotein-Cysteine \"lyso-form\"| |CITS: [22135097][22303020][28320885]|.")

Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are lipoproteins, including the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins that carry fats in the blood stream.

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic lipoproteins are quite different. Eukaryotic lipoproteins are complex particles with a central core containing cholesterol esters and triglycerides, surrounded by free cholesterol and phospholipids, and serve to transport these lipids in aqueous media such as blood plasma or other extracellular fluids. Plasma lipoproteins are divided into seven classes based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoproteins. These groups are chylomicrons (ULDL), chylomicron remnants, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)].

Prokaryotic lipoproteins, on the other hand, are lipoylated at their N-terminal by a single lipid molecule.

[Slot COMMENT in Cytochromes-c changed
from   ("<i>C</i>-type cytochromes (cytC) are electron-transfer proteins that have one or more |FRAME: HEME_C| groups. They are characterized by the covalent attachment of the heme to the polypeptide chain via two (or rarely one) thioether bonds formed between thiol groups of cysteine residues and vinyl groups of the heme molecule. The two cysteine residues almost always occur in the amino-acid sequence CXXCH |CITS: [10647174]|.

<i>C</i>-type cytochromes possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in <i>c</i>-type cytochromes among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species. The use of the term term \"<i>c</i>-type cytochromes\" was introduced to distinguish this family of diverse proteins from the well-characterized mitochondrial protein, which is often referred to as \"cytochrome <i>c</i>\".

Bacterial <i>c</i>-type cytochromes function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 

The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c \"<i>C</i>-type cytochromes\"| have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):

|FRAME: Class-I-Cytochromes-C \"Class I\"| includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the heme-attachment site towards the N-terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C-terminus. Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome <i>c</i>2, mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i>, split-a-band cytochromes <i>c</i>, cytochrome <i>c</i>8 and cytochrome <i>c</i>5, respectively .

|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C \"Class II\"| includes the high-spin cytochromes <i>c</i>' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome <i>c</i>-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.

|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C \"Class III\"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes <i>c</i>3 and <i>c</i>7, with only around thirty residues of amino acid per heme group.

|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C \"Class IV\"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme <i>c</i>, such as the flavocytochromes <i>c</i> and the cytochromes <i>cd</i>.")

[Slot COMMENT in Cyanophycin changed
from   ("|FRAME: Cyanophycin Cyanophycin| is an amino acid polymer that is found in most cyanobacteria. It is a high-molecular weight copolymer, composed of an |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| backbone and |FRAME: ARG| side groups, with typical size of  25-100 kDa. The arginine moieties are linked to the &beta;-carboxyl group of each aspartate by its &alpha;-amino group.

Cyanophycin is largely insoluble under physiological conditions and is accumulated in the form of granules in the cytoplasm during phosphate or sulfur starvation, generally in the early and mid-stationary phase |CITS: [16591901]|.

The polymer serves as a temporary nitrogen reserve, which accumulates during the transition from the exponential- to the stationary-growth phase and disappears when balanced growth resumes.

Even though cyanophycin is considered largely exclusive for cyanobacteria, it is also found in a few heterotrophic bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-62977| |CITS: [11976746][15289556]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in iota-Carrageenan changed
from   ("|FRAME: Carrageenans Carrageenans| and |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| are sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from sea weeds belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-2763| (red algae), mainly from |FRAME: TAX-2769|, and species from the |FRAME: TAX-31444| and |FRAME: TAX-33664| genera. They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.

The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the
number and the position of sulfated ester |CITS: [1367970]|. 

In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.

The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.

to     ("|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| is a vitamin B12-dependent zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| to homocysteine.

Methionine synthase is one of two eukaryotic enzymes that require a cobalamin prosthetic group for activity. Unlike the other enzyme (|FRAME: EC-5.4.99.2|), which requires adenosylcobalamin, the cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase needs to be methylated. Upon the initial transfer of a cob(II)alamin cofactor from a |FRAME: CPD-20918|, it is methylated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|, which uses |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as the methyl donor. The methyl group is subsequently transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, leaving the cofactor briefly in a cob(I)alamin form, which is regenerated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by a transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N \"5-methyltetrahydrofolate\"| |CITS: [2407589]|.

The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalysed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.2|).

A histidine residue embedded in the canonical B<sub>12</sub>-binding DxHxxG motif in methionine synthase serves as the lower axial ligand to the cobalt, which is bound in the \"base-off/His-on\" state |CITS: [7992050]|.")

from   ("|FRAME: Carrageenans Carrageenans| and |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| are sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from sea weeds belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-2763| (red algae), mainly from |FRAME: TAX-2769|, and species from the |FRAME: TAX-31444| and |FRAME: TAX-33664| genera. They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.

The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the
number and the position of sulfated ester |CITS: [1367970]|. 

In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.

The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.

to     ("One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green fluorescence when irradiated with UV light.<br> This fluorescence is due to F<sub>420</sub>, a flavin-related redox-active compound that is used as a cosubstrate by many enzymes in these organisms.

While it is well-known for its role in methanogenesis, factor 420 has also been found in various eubacteria of the actinobacteria class, such as Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Nocardioides, and Mycobacterium, where it assists in the synthesis of antibiotics like tetracycline and lincomycin. In addition, a modified form of the cofactor is also used by cyanobacteria in the repair of DNA damage.

[Slot COMMENT in Carrageenoses changed
from   ("|FRAME: Carrageenans Carrageenans| and |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| are sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from sea weeds belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-2763| (red algae), mainly from |FRAME: TAX-2769|, and species from the |FRAME: TAX-31444| and |FRAME: TAX-33664| genera. They are laid out in the cell wall at a high density and can constitute up to 50% of the algae dry mass.

The basic units of |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenans| are repeats of alternating &beta; -1,3 linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4- linked D-galactose units, which are often substituted by sulfate. Carrageenans are classified according to the
number and the position of sulfated ester |CITS: [1367970]|. 

In |FRAME: Carrageenoses carrageenoses| the &alpha;-1,4- linked galactose units are modified by having a 3,6 - anhydro bridge. These bridges, which form a double helix during aggregation, are responsible for the gelation that is typical to these compounds. Despite this distinction, carrageenoses are often referred to as carrageenans.

The three most industrially exploited carrageenans, namely, |FRAME: kappa-Carrageenan|, |FRAME: iota-Carrageenan| and |FRAME: Lambda-Carrageenan|, are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three ester-sulfate groups per repeating disaccharide unit respectively.")

from   ("4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) is a prosthetic group of several enzymes |CITS: [12686130]| that is formed by autocatalytic post-translational modifications of three amino acids within the protein (generally A-S-G but T-S-G has also been reported) |CITS: [10220322][22319000]|.

The MIO group is an electrophile, and reacts with an amino group of the substrate [&alpha;-phenylalanine, &alpha;-tyrosine, or &alpha;-histidine, depending on the enzyme). This interaction facilitates the stereoselective abstraction of one of the C&beta; protons by a nearby tyrosine base located in the lid loop that covers the active site of the enzyme |CITS: [11732994][17185228][17516659][18346767]|. The abstraction of the proton is accompanied, sequentially or simultaneously, by the cleavage of the N-C&alpha; bond and leads to the formation of a product with an unsaturated C&alpha;-C&beta; bond.

The last step depends on the nature of the enzyme. in lyases, the unsaturated product and the amino
group (as ammonia) are released into the environment |CITS: [5354960]|. In aminomutases the amine group (as a MIO-amine adduct) and the unsaturated product are retained in the active site and the unsaturated product is reaminated and reprotonated at the other C atom |CITS: [15494399 ][18078753][21561099]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in PrdC-Proteins changed
from   ("PrdC is a selenocysteine-containing protein found in many proteinolytic Clostridium species that is involved in the reduction of |FRAME: D-PROLINE|D-proline to |FRAME: 5-AMINOPENTANOATE|.

The prdC gene is located in the D-proline reductase operon and has been originally annotated as an electron transfer protein |CITS: [Kabisch01]|. It was later found to encode a protein that contains a selenocysteine residue |CITS: [20937090]|.

According to the proposed model, catalysis by |FRAME: EC-1.21.4.1|, begins by the binding of |FRAME: D-PROLINE| the pyruvoyl group of the PrdA protein. The dissociated, nucleophilic selenocysteine moiety in PrdB attacks the &alpha;-C-atom of D-proline, leading to a reductive cleavage of the C-N-bond of the pyrrolidine ring and the formation of a selenoether. The selenoether is then cleaved by a cysteine moiety of PrdB, resulting in a mixed selenide-sulfide bond in the active site of PrdB.

This bond is then reduced by a special terminal sulfide-selenide group of PrdC, restoring PrdB to its active state, and resulting in formation of a mixed selenide-sulfide bond in PrdC, which is then reduced to the active form by NADH.
Finally, |FRAME: 5-AMINOPENTANOATE| is released from PrdA by hydrolysis, regenerating the pyruvoyl moiety |CITS: [20937090]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in Glycosyl-IPCs changed
from   ("In this class of glycosylinositol phosphoceramides, a long carbon chain is attached at position R1 to form a fatty amide and a long carbon chain is attached at position R2 to form a long chain base. Either or both of these chains may contain one or more double bonds and may have hydroxyl groups attached.

To describe subclasses of this class, the following notation is used: GIPC(m:n)-p. The total number of carbons present in the sphingoid base and the fatty amide is \"m\" while the total number of double bonds is \"n.\" The total number of hydroxyl groups (not including the hydroxyl group used as the site of the head group attachment) is \"p.\" 
")
to     ("Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs) are found only in plants, fungi, and some protozoa. For GIPC biosynthesis, |FRAME: Ceramides| is trafficked to the Golgi, where a phosphorylinositol headgroup is added to form |FRAME: Inositol-Phosphoceramides| (IPC) by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.227| (IPC synthase) |CITS: [19001565]|. The IPC core can then be glycosylated by various glycosyltransferases to produce mature GIPCs |CITS: [27895225]|.

The biosynthesis of IPCs is well conserved between plants and fungi |CITS: [15037448]|. However, plant GIPCs are more highly glycosylated than those in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, usually containing &alpha;-glucuronate linked to the IPC core structure, to which additional sugar units such as glucosamine (GlcN), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), mannose (Man), and arabinose (Ara) may be attached |CITS: [16772288][21953969][23499054]|.

While it is well-known for its role in methanogenesis, factor 420 has also been found in various eubacteria of the actinobacteria class, such as Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Nocardioides, and Mycobacterium, where it assists in the synthesis of antibiotics like tetracycline and lincomycin. In addition, a modified form of the cofactor is also used by cyanobacteria in the repair of DNA damage.

The term \"|FRAME: HEME_D|\" has been used to describe the heme group found in two types of proteins: terminal oxidases such as the |FRAME: CYT-D-UBIOX-CPLX| and |FRAME: APP-UBIOX-CPLX| that predominate in |FRAME: TAX-562| at low levels of oxygen |CITS: [6307994]|, and a family of catalase enzymes, such as |FRAME: HYDROPEROXIDII-CPLX| from |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [Chiu89][18498226]|.

Initial spectroscopy data on these enzymes suggested the presence of a &gamma;-spirolactone at the saturated pyrrole ring III of the macrocycle in the C-6 position and a vicinal C-5 hydroxy group |CITS: [Sotiriu88]|, although the relative orientation of these two groups was shown to be different in the two proteins (the two substituents have the more stable <i>trans</i> configuration in the terminal oxidases, but a <i>cis</i> configuration in HPII |CITS: [Chiu89]|). The absolute stereochemistry of the two chiral centers has not been reported |CITS: [8621527]|.

From there the electrons are transferred via ubiquinone to the oxidative branch of the respiratory chain, and potentially also to |FRAME: CPLX-3121 \"ammonia monooxygenase\"| (directly or indirectly) |CITS: [18031536]|. 

The protein is encoded by the |FRAME: G-15262| gene. Two copies of the gene exist on the chromosome, and both are preceded by three genes encoding proteins involved in the oxidation of hydroxylamine: |FRAME: G-2864 <i>haoA</i>|, encoding |FRAME: CPLX-1321|; orf2, a putative membrane protein; and |FRAME: G-15261 <i>cycA</i>|, encoding |FRAME: MONOMER-17537| |CITS: [8195067][12700255]|. 

The protein has been purified, and found to be monomeric protein of 27 kDa. Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed the presence of high-spin and low-spin hemes in a 1:3 ratio. Comparative modeling, based on the crystal structure and conserved residues of the homologous NrfH protein from Desulfovibrio predicted a Met-ligated high-spin heme in a quinone-binding pocket, and likely axial ligands to all four hemes |CITS: [18505274]|.")

In the absence of calcium ions, this complex is stable, explaining why oxygen is not needed for the downstream light-emitting step. When calcium ions become available, they bind to three calcium-binding sites, triggering the aequorin luminescence reaction. During the reaction, a change in the conformation of aequorin takes place, leading to cyclization of the peroxide into a dioxetanone structure, which collapses, releasing a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. The spontaneous breakdown of the dioxetanone releases the energy (about 60 kcal/mole) that is necessary to generate an |FRAME: CPD-20235 \"excited state of coelentramide|. <i>In vitro</i> this decarboxylation is accompanied by the emission of blue light, while <i>in vivo</i> the energy is transferred to excite |FRAME: GFP \"a green fluorescent protein\"| by <A href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer\">F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer</A> (FRET) |CITS: [4151620]|.

The enzyme was first purified in 1962 from the jellyfish |FRAME: TAX-168712|.

[Slot COMMENT in DsrC-trisulfides changed

In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.

DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. A second cyteine residue (CysB), located 11 residues before CysA, is also involved in DsrC's activity.

In the sulfur-oxidizer |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides \"a perthiol on CysA\"|.

In the sulfur-oxidizing bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides \"a perthiol on CysA\"|. This perthiol is oxidized to form a trisulfide bridge with CysB. This trisulfide bridge then serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes an oxidation reaction. The oxidized middle sulfur is released in the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with two reduced cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485][20952577]|.

In sulfite reducers DsrAB catalyzes the opposite reaction, adding the sulfur atom of sulfite to DsrC and forming the trisulfide bridge with the two cysteine residues. This third sulfur atom is then released in the form of hydrogen sulfide in a reaction catalyzed by DsrK, restoring DsrC to its reduced form |CITS: [26680199]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in Aequorins changed
from   ("The key enzyme in the jellyfish bioluminescence system is the single protein |FRAME: Aequorins aequorin|, also known as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated photoprotein. The name |FRAME: Aequorins aequorin| refers not to the gene product, which is named |FRAME: Apoaequorins aopaequorin|, but rather to the non-covalent complex formed by apoaequorin and a |FRAME: CPD-20222 hydroperoxide of coelenterazine\"|. This complex is formed by binding of the coelenterazine chromophore, followed by its peroxidation with molecular oxygen. In the absence of calcium ions, this complex is stable, explaining why oxygen is not needed for the downstream light-emitting step. When calcium ions become available, they bind to three calcium-binding sites, triggering the aequorin luminescence reaction. During the reaction, a change in the conformation of aequorin takes place, leading to cyclization of the peroxide into a dioxetanone structure, which collapses, releasing a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. The spontaneous breakdown of the dioxetanone releases the energy (about 60 kcal/mole) that is necessary to generate an |FRAME: CPD-20235 \"excited state of coelentramide|. <i>In vitro</i> this decarboxylation is accompanied by the emission of blue light, while <i>in vivo</i> the energy is transferred to excite |FRAME: GFP \"a green fluorescent protein\"| by <A href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer\">F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer</A> (FRET) |CITS: [4151620]|.

During the luminescence reaction aequorin is converted into a |FRAME: Excited-blue-fluorescent-proteins \"blue fluorescent protein\"| (BFP), a dissociable complex of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound apoaequorin and coelenteramide. It has been shown that BFP has the activity of luciferase and can catalyze the oxidation of coelenterazine to coelenteramide on its own |CITS: [15527769][16545379][19549504]|.

The enzyme was first purified in 1962 from the jellyfish |FRAME: TAX-168712|. The purification involved the painstaking collection and processing of more than 10,000 jellyfish, and resulted in 5 mg of purified protein |CITS: [Shimomura62][13911999][7654844]|. Cloning and expression of the complementary DNA for aequorin were first reported in 1985 |CITS: [3858813][2579647]|. Sequence analysis showed the presence of three E-F hand structures that are characteristic for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, and an overall structure similar to that of calmoduline.

Crystals of the recombinant protein were prepared in 1993, but their quality was not sufficient for X-ray analysis |CITS: [8451237]|. Higher quality crystals were generated later and used for obtaining the full crystal structure  at 2.3 &Aring; resolution. The protein scaffold consists of four EF-hand domains arranged in pairs to form the globular molecule, with each pair of 'hands' arranged back-to-back, forming short stretches of beta-sheet, as seen in other EF-hand proteins. The crystal structure also confirmed that coelenterazine and oxygen are bound in the form of coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide |CITS: [10830969]|. A crystal structure of calcium-loaded apo-aequorin has shown that all three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops bind calcium ions |CITS: [15689515]|.

Aequorin has become important tools for molecular biology, where it provides a highly sensitive and rapid assay for measuring intra-organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> and assessing its role in physiological and pathological functions |CITS: [7042960][1917380][8531755][11256942][12690959][24382647]|.")

O-linked glycosylation, where the glycan is attached to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine, threonine, tyrosine, hydroxylysine, or hydroxyproline side-chains.

Other, less common, forms of protein glycosylation include phosphoglycans, in which the glycan is linked through the phosphate of a phosphoserine, and C-linked glycans, where the glycan is attached to a carbon on a tryptophan side-chain.

A special form of protein glycosylation is glypiation, in which a protein is attached to a lipid anchor via a glycan chain.

[Slot COMMENT in O-Antigens changed
from   ("<i>O</i>-antigens are part of |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (|FRAME: Lipid-A \"lipid A\"|), a |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides \"core oligosaccharide\"|, and polysaccharide side chains known as the <i>O</i>-antigen.

The composition of the <i>O</i>-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the <i>O</i>-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.

The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered smooth or rough, respectively. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the <i>O</i>-antigen, in addition to the \"smoothness\" of the strain.")

[Slot COMMENT in Oxidized-ferredoxins changed
from   ("|FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers \"iron-sulfur clusters\"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.

Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins \"[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin\"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.

|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins \"[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins\"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins \"[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins\"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins \"2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins\"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.

Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.")

Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

The term \"|FRAME: HEME_C|\" has been used to describe the heme group attached to |FRAME: Cytochromes-c \"<i>c</i>-type cytochromes\"|. Heme <i>c</i> differs from |FRAME: Heme-b| in that the two vinyl side chains of the latter are replaced by covalent, thioether linkages to the apoprotein.

The covalent bonds prevent |FRAME: HEME_C| from easily dissociating from the cytochrome <i>c</i> holoprotein, unlike the case of |FRAME: Heme-b|- and |FRAME: HEME_A|-containing cytochromes.

Since the modifications that define the heme <i>c</i> molecule are generated by its attachment to the protein, it does not naturally occur in a free form. The sulfur atoms shown in this structure are not an integral part of the heme molecule, but rather show the location of the thioether bonds.

A different type of ETF possess electron transfer bifurcating activity: ability to accept a pair of electrons from NADH and use one to generate a strong reductant such as flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin. This endergonic electron transfer is paid for by exergonic transfer of the other electron to a strong electron acceptor via a corresponding partner enzyme, such as a quinone reductase in the case of ETFs associated with nitrogen fixation, or |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) in the case of some butanoate-producing anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [14688238]|.

The bifurcating ETFs are also heterodimeric, but contain two FAD molecules (the presence of AMP has not been reported). The hydride group from NADH is transferred to the first FAD (the so-called bifurcating FAD or Bf-FAD), which passes one electron exergonically to the second FAD. By passing only a single electron the Bf-FAD assumes a reactive semiquinone state able to reduce ferredoxin or flavodoxin semiquinone. The second FAD (the electron transfer FAD, or ET-FAD), which correspond to the single FAD present in canonical ETFs, passes the electron it received to the second acceptor via exergonic electron transfer |CITS: [31588324]|.

from   ("The electron transferring-flavoproteins (ETF) serve as specific electron carriers for other dehydrogenases. They transfer the electrons to the main respiratory chain via |FRAME: EC-1.5.5.1| (ETF dehydrogenase).

A different type of ETF possess electron transfer bifurcating activity: ability to accept a pair of electrons from NADH and use one to generate a strong reductant such as flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin. This endergonic electron transfer is paid for by exergonic transfer of the other electron to a strong electron acceptor via a corresponding partner enzyme, such as a quinone reductase in the case of ETFs associated with nitrogen fixation, or |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) in the case of some butanoate-producing anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [14688238]|.

The bifurcating ETFs are also heterodimeric, but contain two FAD molecules (the presence of AMP has not been reported). The hydride group from NADH is transferred to the first FAD (the so-called bifurcating FAD or Bf-FAD), which passes one electron exergonically to the second FAD. By passing only a single electron the Bf-FAD assumes a reactive semiquinone state able to reduce ferredoxin or flavodoxin semiquinone. The second FAD (the electron transfer FAD, or ET-FAD), which correspond to the single FAD present in canonical ETFs, passes the electron it received to the second acceptor via exergonic electron transfer |CITS: [31588324]|.

to     ("|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| is a vitamin B12-dependent zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| to homocysteine.

Methionine synthase is one of two eukaryotic enzymes that require a cobalamin prosthetic group for activity. Unlike the other enzyme (|FRAME: EC-5.4.99.2|), which requires adenosylcobalamin, the cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase needs to be methylated. Upon the initial transfer of a cob(II)alamin cofactor from a |FRAME: CPD-20918|, it is methylated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|, which uses |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as the methyl donor. The methyl group is subsequently transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, leaving the cofactor briefly in a cob(I)alamin form, which is regenerated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by a transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N \"5-methyltetrahydrofolate\"| |CITS: [2407589]|.

The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalysed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.2|).")

During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.

Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strengtth.

Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN \"manganese peroxidase\"|, |FRAME: RXN-17136 \"lignin peroxidase\"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN \"cellobiose dehydrogenase\"|.")

[Slot COMMENT in N5-Formyl-THF-Glu-N changed
from   ("|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

Among the many folates |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF \"(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate\"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|.

[Slot COMMENT in FORMYL-THF-GLU-N changed
from   ("|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

[Slot COMMENT in THF-GLU-N changed
from   ("|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

This class stands for tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.")

One of these fucosyltransferases, encoded by the |FRAME: HS10249| gene, is bifunctional and can fucosylate both the 3 and 4 positions of the penultimate sugar in the precursor disaccharide. The gene, also known as the Lewis gene, has a dominant allele (which was named Le) and a recessive non-functional allele (known as le). The &alpha;(1,4)-fucosyltransferase activity is only relevant when the substrates are derived from the |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R \"type 1 precursor disaccharide\"|, as that position is already occupied in the |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R \"type 2 disaccharide\"|.

The first Lewis antigens to be discovered were the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope \"Lewis a\"| and |FRAME: Antigen-Leb \"Lewis b\"| antigens, which are produced from |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R \"type 1 precursor disaccharides\"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7832|). However, the &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| leads to formation of several related antigens known as the |FRAME: CPD-8594 \"Lewis x epitope\"| (also known as SSEA-1, for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1), |FRAME: Antigen-Ley \"Lewis y epitope\"|, and the |FRAME: sLea-Antigen \"sialyl-Lewis x epitope\"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7831|).")

Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.

Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores \"catechols\"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores \"hydroxamates\"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores \"thiazolines\"|. 
Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores \"phytosiderophores\"| are also known as mugineic acids.

Thiazoline siderophores are named based on the presence of a thiazoline (5-membered heterocyclic compound containing both sulfur and nitrogen in the ring) element in their structures.")

These epitopes are involved in a variety of biological processes including pathogen adhesion, fertilization, and tumor metastasis.

This disaccharide is also present in other important oligosaccharides, such as |FRAME: CPD-16473| (LNT). LNT and its fucosylated and/or sialylated derivatives are among some of the major components in human milk oligosaccharides. Some of them share similar structures with the glycan ligands recognized by human pathogens and are proposed to protect infants against these pathogens via competitive inhibition of the binding between the pathogens and the epithelial ligands |CITS: [1670932][15314189]|.")

from   ("Colanic acid, also known as the M antigen, is an extracellular polysaccharide found in Enterobacteriaceae |CITS: [16418870]|. Colanic acid is a heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are non-stoichiometrically decorated with O-acetyl and pyruvate side-chains.

The colanic acid polysaccharide repeat is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, linked to the membrane by the lipid anchor |FRAME: CPD-9650|. The precursors are provided in their activated form (|FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CPD-13118|, |FRAME: CPD-14553| and |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE|), and added to the oligosaccharide by a series of glycosyl transferases.

Once assembled, the single repeat is flipped to the periplasmic side and polymerized by the Wzy-dependent pathway. Following polymerization, the polymer is cleaved from the |FRAME: CPD-9650|, transported across the periplasm, and excreted into the extracellular space.")
to     ("|FRAME: CPD0-1099 \"Colanic acid\"| is an exopolysaccharide secreted by |FRAME: TAX-562| and a number of other |FRAME: TAX-543| that encapsulates the organism, resulting in a mucoid appearance |CITS: [13963285]|. Colanic acid is thought to promote biofilm formation and to protect the organism when exposed to harsh environments such as acidic conditions |CITS:  [11371548][16706906]|.

Even though it wasn't identified as such, colanic acid was first described in 1927 by Dorothea Smith, who isolated a polysaccharide from a mucoid strain of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [19869322]|. Fourteen years later, in a study on the antigens of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, it was noticed that one antigen was common to several mucoid strains of |FRAME: TAX-57045| |CITS: [Kauffmann41]|. It was soon reported that the same antigen, which was named \"M\" antigen, is produced by mucoid <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains |CITS: [15406247]|. In 1954 Kauffmann reported that the antigen was common to all mucoid <i>Salmonella</i> species |CITS: [Kauffmann54]|.

Similar exopolysaccharides were reported from a number of mucoid strains and species |CITS: [13475241][13641209][13963285][14073028][5324934]|. In the early 60s it was reported that a large number of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> strains that are not normally mucoid can be induced to form slime exopolysaccharides when grown at 15 to 20&deg;C in high phosphate concentration |CITS: [Anderson61][Anderson63]|, and the exopolysaccharide was named \"colanic acid\" after |FRAME: TAX-562| from which it was isolated |CITS: [13963285]|. In a paper describing the discovery of the same polysaccharide in |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was suggested that colanic acid and the \"M antigen\" reported in the earlier studies are identical |CITS: [14206589]|. A confirmation was obtained in 1969 when it was shown that colanic acid of identical composition is produced by strains from the genera <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia</i>, and <i>Aerobacter</i>. At that time the exact structure was not known, though it was known that the polysaccharide contains glucose, galactose, fucose, and glucuronate, as well as some <i>O</i>-acetyl groups |CITS: [ 4902806]|.

Additional structural studies have shown that colanic acid from different organisms is very similar, with the polysaccharide composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose, two fucoses, two galactoses, and glucuronate. In addition, one fucose and one galactose may be acetylated to varying degrees, and the terminal galactose residue is modified. The repeat units are connected by a linkage between the first and third residues, with the remaining three residues forming a side chain |CITS: [4311825][4902692]|. Differences are found in the modifications of the terminal galactose residue, which was found to contain a 4,6-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-ethylidene group, or a 4,6-methylene group in different strains |CITS: [4941627]|. The structure shown here was published in 2007, correcting several errors in earlier reports |CITS: [17227761]|. While colanic acid was considered exclusively an exopolysaccharide that is only loosely associated with the cell surface, the 2007 study also found that colanic acid can be attached to the lipid A core of lipopolysaccharide instead of the O antigen, forming a novel type of lipopolysaccharide which was named |FRAME:

In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.

The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.

Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.

As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 

Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 \"complex I\"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 \"complex II\"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 \"complex III\"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 \"photosystem I\"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 \"xanthine dehydrogenase\"|.

Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 \"4Fe-4S clusters\"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.

It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.")

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 

Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A \"lipid A\"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides \"core oligosaccharide\"|, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.

Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negatives, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.

[Slot COMMENT in 2Fe-2S-proteins changed
from   ("|FRAME: FeS-Proteins \"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins\"| contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.

The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.

Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.

As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 

Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 \"complex I\"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 \"complex II\"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 \"complex III\"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 \"photosystem I\"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 \"xanthine dehydrogenase\"|.

Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 \"4Fe-4S clusters\"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.

It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.")

Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-7.1.1.2 \"complex I\"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 \"complex II\"| and |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.8 \"complex III\"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 \"photosystem I\"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 \"xanthine dehydrogenase\"|.

Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 \"4Fe-4S clusters\"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.

It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.")

In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.

The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.

Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|.

In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues.

[Slot COMMENT in 5-10-METHENYL-THF-GLU-N changed
from   ("|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

This class stands for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.")
to     ("|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
